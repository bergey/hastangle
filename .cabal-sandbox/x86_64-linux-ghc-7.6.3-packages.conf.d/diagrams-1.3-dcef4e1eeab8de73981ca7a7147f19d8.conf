synopsis: Embedded domain-specific language for declarative vector graphics
description: Diagrams is a full-featured framework and embedded domain-specific langauge for creating
             declarative vector graphics and animations.
             .
             This package is just a convenient wrapper
             around the @diagrams-core@, @diagrams-lib@ and
             @diagrams-contrib@ packages, so they can be
             installed with a single @cabal install diagrams@
             command.
             .
             The package also comes with flags to enable six
             different backends.
             A Haskell-native SVG
             backend (the @diagrams-svg@ package)
             can be selected with @-fsvg@. This
             flag is enabled by default, so if you do /not/
             want the SVG backend, you must explicitly
             disable it with @-f-svg@.  The SVG backend does not
             yet quite support all the features of the cairo
             backend: text alignment and embedded images are
             the two main missing features at this point, and
             of course it can only produce SVG images. It is,
             however, much easier to install, so it is the
             out-of-the-box default.
             .
             There is also a cairo backend (the
             @diagrams-cairo@ package) which can be selected
             with the @-fcairo@ flag. It is fully-featured and
             can produce PNG, PS, PDF, SVG, or animated
             GIF output; however,
             due to its dependencies it can be difficult to
             install on some platforms (notably OS X).
             .
             In addition, there is a GTK backend based on the
             cairo backend, for rendering diagrams directly to
             GTK windows. You can enable it with the @-fgtk@ flag.
             .
             The Haskell-native postscript
             backend (the @diagrams-postscript@ package)
             can be selected with the @-fpostscript@ flag.  The only
             feature it does not support is transparency.
             .
             There is a Rasterific backend which is
             also Haskell-native (the @diagrams-rasterific@
             package) which can be selected with the @-frasterific@
             flag. This is a fully featured backend with the ability
             to produce PNG, JPG, TIFF, BMP and animated GIF output.
             .
             Finally there is a Canvas backend, also haskell native,
             which can be selected with the @-fcanvas@ flag. This
             backend allows users to write interactive images onto
             their web browsers.
             .
